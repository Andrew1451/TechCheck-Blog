## What is useEffect? <a name='what'></a>
If you're familiar with the lifecycle methods of class based components (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, etc..), the useEffect hook is basically all of those methods rolled up into one convenient function. If you're *not* familiar with those lifecycle methods, you're very lucky &#128514; &#128557;.

useEffect is a function that you can configure to run every time a component mounts.. or unmounts.. or only on the initial render.. You can reach out to a third party API, or your own backend to retrieve data. It's very powerful. It's also not as complicated as it may seem.

## How Do You Use It? <a name='how'></a>

You'll start off by importing it from React. Note that we have it inside curly braces because it's a named import.

```javascript
import { useEffect } from 'react';
```
As stated before, it's a function. So you'll call that function.
```javascript
useEffect()
```
You'll pass an anonymous function into that function as an argument. That's the code you want to run when useEffect is called.
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    // executable code here.
    // grab data, update state, etc..
})
```
## Controlling When useEffect is Called <a name='when'></a>
So we're passing a function into useEffect. As of now, that function (and useEffect itself) will be called *everytime* the component re-renders. If there's an input and the user is typing, that component will re-render on *every* keystroke. 

If you're reaching out to your backend to retrieve some data, you probably don't want to do that on every keystroke.

That's where the dependency array comes in.

## The Dependency Array <a name='array'></a>
The function we're sending into useEffect is an argument. It can also take a second argument, which is a dependency array. 

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    // this function is an argument
}, [/* this array is, too */])
```
If you put a property in this array, useEffect will only be called when that property changes.

> Except for the initial render. 
> useEffect will always run at least
> once; on the initial render.

So let's say you have some state. We'll use a counter example. If you want useEffect to run only when that `count` property changes, you'll put `count` in the dependency array.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    console.log(count)
}, [count])
```

Now let's say you want useEffect to run on the initial render, but not on any re-render. No matter what properties change. For that, you'd pass an empty dependency array. 

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    console.log(count)
}, [])
```

## Cleaning Up <a name='clean-up'></a>
You know that function that we send into another function? Well, that function can return something...

...another function.

Ok hear me out.

That function you can return, is a *clean up* function. That's where you would unsubscribe to a subscription or clear a setTimeout that you don't need anymore. 

For example, if we have a setTimeout that's supposed to be called after 9 seconds, and the user is typing, (causing a bunch of re-renders), we don't want a bunch of 9 second timers going on in the background. So we'll return a function which is a clearTimeout.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('time!')
    }, 9000)
    return () => {
        clearTimeout(timer)
    }
}, [])
```

Now, any time that component re-renders, (or if the user goes to a different page, and the timer isn't needed anymore), the asynchronous timeout will not be using memory in the background. 

## Conclusion <a name='conclusion'></a>
useEffect is a very powerful part of React. It may seem like a lot at first, but once you understand it and use it a couple times, it's not so bad.

I have a YouTube video with a few different examples. I also show exactly when useEffect is being called in different situations, and how to have more control over it.

Hope this helped somebody and thank you for reading!
