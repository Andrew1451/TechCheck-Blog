## Why useFetch?

It's very common to fetch data when the user goes to a certain page. We also use common logic when fetching that data. 

There's also a fair amount of boilerplate/logic that crowds our components and it's not very DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

These are all good reasons to make a custom hook. We can outsource that boilerplate/logic into one separate file. That file will hold the function (hook) which will return for us what we need to use in our components. 

## The Old Way

In this example, I'll use the `useState` hook to keep track of the loading state, any error, and the data. I'll use the `useEffect` hook to run all of that code. Lastly, I'm using axios to fetch the data, and a cancel token to cancel any unfinished requests that we don't need anymore.

```javascript
//App.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [quote, setQuote] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
      setLoading('loading...')
      setQuote(null);
      setError(null);
      const source = axios.CancelToken.source();
      axios.get('https://api.quotable.io/random', { cancelToken: source.token })
      .then(res => {
          setLoading(false);
          setQuote(res.data.content);
      })
      .catch(err => {
          setLoading(false)
          setError('An error occurred. Awkward..')
      })
      return () => {
          source.cancel();
      }
  }, [])

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <button onClick={fetchQuote}>Fetch Quote</button>
      { loading && <p>{loading}</p> }
      { quote && <p>"{quote}"</p> }
      { error && <p>{error}</p> }
    </div>
  )
}

export default App;
```

That's a lot of code. Let's move most of it.

## The New Way

We'll create another file called `useFetch.js`. You want to start the name of a custom hook with "use" so that React knows to treat it like a hook.

Let's copy over the import statements, all 3 useStates, and the useEffect function. 

```javascript
//useFetch.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function useFetch(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
      setLoading('loading...')
      setData(null);
      setError(null);
      const source = axios.CancelToken.source();
      axios.get(url, { cancelToken: source.token })
      .then(res => {
          setLoading(false);
          //checking for multiple responses for more flexibility 
          //with the url we send in.
          res.data.content && setData(res.data.content);
          res.content && setData(res.content);
      })
      .catch(err => {
          setLoading(false)
          setError('An error occurred. Awkward..')
      })
      return () => {
          source.cancel();
      }
  }, [url])

  return { data, loading, error }

export default useFetch;
```

You may have noticed some changes. First of all, the function (which is our hook), is named useFetch. It receives a parameter which is the url we want to get data from.

We also changed `setQuote` to `setData`, making it more versatile. Notice that we also check for multiple responses to make it more flexible as well.

Lastly, our useFetch function (hook) returns our data, loading, and any error.

> I put those in an object so we can use *object* destructuring when accessing those in our component. That way, the order doesn't matter when we destructure them, and we can rename them if we want. I'll show you that next.

## Using useFetch in Our Component

So, back in our App component, we'll import our useFetch hook from `useFetch.js`, and pass in the url we want to fetch data from. We'll use object destructuring to access what we need. Lastly, we'll rename data to quote.

```javascript
import useFetch from './useFetch';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const { data: quote, loading, error } = useFetch('https://api.quotable.io/random')
    
  return (
    <div className="App">
      { loading && <p>{loading}</p> }
      { quote && <p>"{quote}"</p> }
      { error && <p>{error}</p> }
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Muuuuuch cleaner üòé.

## Conclusion

Custom hooks are very useful for cleaning up your code. You can use React hooks inside of your custom hooks (they're all functions after all! üëç). You can encapsulate a lot of repetitive logic, then return what you need from the custom hook.
